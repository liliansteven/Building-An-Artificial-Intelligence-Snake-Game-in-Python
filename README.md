# Building An Snake Game in Python Using A* Algorithm  :-

PySnake is an artificial intelligence that learns to control a snake. This AI learns to recognize its environment and choose the best direction to survive. This model uses A* Algorithm theory, as there is no training data available.

The game is simple. The player / AI control a snake in four directions : UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible, increasing the snake's length. The snake dies when it eats itself or crash in a wall.
